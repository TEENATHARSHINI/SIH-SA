   - 20+ neutral indicators for balanced analysis
   - Intensifier detection (very, extremely, highly, etc.)
   - Negation handling (not, never, hardly, etc.)

2. **Advanced Context Processing**:
   - Conditional context patterns
   - Comparative analysis
   - Temporal considerations
   - Certainty level detection

3. **Precise Word Highlighting**:
   - **MAXIMUM 3 justification words** per analysis
   - Color-coded highlighting (green=positive, pink=negative, yellow=neutral)
   - HTML-safe rendering with proper styling
   - Only highlights words that directly influence sentiment
